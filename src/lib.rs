//! A generated entity component system ðŸ¦Ž
//!
//! The gecs crate provides a compile-time generated, zero-overhead ECS for simulations
//! on a budget. Unlike other ECS libraries, gecs takes a full ECS world structure
//! definition from code and precompiles all queries to achieve better performance with
//! no upfront cost or caching overhead. Queries in gecs can be inspected and checked at
//! compile-time in order to catch what would otherwise be bugs presenting only in tests
//! or execution. However, this comes at the cost of requiring all archetypes to be known
//! and declared at compile-time, so that adding or removing components from entities at
//! runtime isn't currently possible -- hybrid approaches could solve this in the future.
//!
//! Archetypes in gecs can be set to contain a fixed or dynamic capacity of entities. If
//! all of the archetypes in your ECS world declaration are set to a fixed capacity, gecs
//! will perform zero allocations after startup. This guarantees that your ECS world will
//! adhere to a known and predictable memory overhead for constrained environments (e.g.
//! servers on cloud instances). Attempting to add an entity to a full archetype can
//! either report failure or panic depending on the method you call to do so.
//!
//! The goals for gecs are (in descending priority order):
//! - Fast iteration and find queries
//! - Fast entity creation and destruction
//! - Low, predictable memory overhead
//! - A user-friendly library interface
//! - Simplicity and focus in features
//!
//! All of the code that gecs generates in user crates is safe, and users of gecs can
//! use `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` in their own crates. Note that gecs does use unsafe code
//! internally to allow for compiler optimizations around known invariants. It is not a
//! goal of this library to be written entirely in safe Rust.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! See the [`ecs_world!`], [`ecs_find!`], and [`ecs_iter!`] macros for more information.
//! The following example creates a world with three components and two archetypes:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use gecs::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Components -- these must be pub because the world is exported as pub as well.
//! pub struct CompA(pub u32);
//! pub struct CompB(pub u32);
//! pub struct CompC(pub u32);
//!
//! ecs_world! {
//!     // Declare two archetypes, ArchFoo and ArchBar.
//!     ecs_archetype!(ArchFoo, 100, CompA, CompB); // Fixed capacity of 100 entities.
//!     ecs_archetype!(ArchBar, dyn, CompA, CompC); // Dynamic (dyn) entity capacity.
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut world = EcsWorld::default(); // Initialize an empty new ECS world.
//!
//!     // Add entities to the world by populating their components and receive their handles.
//!     let entity_a = world.create::<ArchFoo>((CompA(1), CompB(20)));
//!     let entity_b = world.create::<ArchBar>((CompA(3), CompC(40)));
//!
//!     // Each archetype now has one entity.
//!     assert_eq!(world.archetype::<ArchFoo>().len(), 1);
//!     assert_eq!(world.archetype::<ArchBar>().len(), 1);
//!
//!     // Look up each entity and check its CompB or CompC value.
//!     // We use the is_some() check here to make sure the entity was indeed found.
//!     assert!(ecs_find!(world, entity_a, |c: &CompB| assert_eq!(c.0, 20)).is_some());
//!     assert!(ecs_find!(world, entity_b, |c: &CompC| assert_eq!(c.0, 40)).is_some());
//!
//!     // Add to entity_a's CompA value.
//!     ecs_find!(world, entity_a, |c: &mut CompA| { c.0 += 1; });
//!
//!     // Sum both entities' CompA values with one iter despite being different archetypes.
//!     let mut sum = 0;
//!     ecs_iter!(world, |c: &CompA| { sum += c.0 });

    /// Macro for declaring a new ECS world struct with archetype storage.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_world!` macro is used for declaring an ECS world data structure to populate
    /// and perform queries on. All types used in the ECS world must be known at compile-time,
    /// and the full structure of each archetype must be declared with the world. Components
    /// may not be added or removed from entities at runtime.
    ///
    /// Note that irrespective of capacity configuration, a single ECS archetype can hold at
    /// most `16,777,216` entities due to the encoding structure of the `Entity` type. For
    /// similar reasons, an ECS world can have only `256` distinct archetypes. Archetypes can
    /// store up to `16` distinct components by default. Use the `32_components` crate feature
    /// to raise this limit to `32` components -- note that this may impact compilation speed.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_world!` macro has several inner pseudo-macros used for declaring archetypes
    /// or performing other tasks such as naming the ECS world's data type. These are not true
    /// macros and have no purpose or meaning outside of the body of an `ecs_world!` declaration.
    ///
    /// ## ecs_name!
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// ecs_name!(Name);
    /// ```
    /// The `ecs_name!` inner pseudo-macro is used for setting the name (in PascalCase) of the
    /// ECS world struct. Without this declaration, the world's name will default to `EcsWorld`.
    ///
    /// ## ecs_archetype!
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// ecs_archetype!(Name, capacity, Component, ...);
    /// ```
    /// The `ecs_archetype!` inner pseudo-macro is used for declaring an archetype in an ECS
    /// world. It takes the following arguments:
    ///
    /// - `Name`: The name (in PascalCase) of the archetype Rust type.
    /// - `capacity`: The capacity of the archetype, specified in one of the following ways:
    ///     - A constant expression (e.g. `200` or `config::ARCH_CAPACITY + 4`). This will
    ///       create a fixed-size archetype that can contain at most that number of entities.
    ///     - The `dyn` keyword can be used to create a dynamically-sized archetype. This can
    ///       grow to accommodate up to `16,777,216` entities. To initialize an ECS world's
    ///       dynamic archetype with a pre-allocated capacity, use the `with_capacity()`
    ///       function at world creation. This function will be automatically generated
    ///       with a named capacity argument for each dynamic archetype in that world.
    /// - `Component, ...`: One or more component types to include in this archetype. Because
    ///   generated archetypes are `pub` with `pub` members, all components must be `pub` too.
    ///
    /// The `ecs_archetype!` declaration supports the following attributes:
    ///
    /// - `#[cfg]` attributes can be used both on the `ecs_archetype!` itself, and on
    ///   individual component parameters.
    /// - `#[archetype_id(N)]` can be used to override this archetype's `ARCHETYPE_ID` to `N`
    ///   (which must be between `0` and `255`). By default, archetype IDs start at `0` and
    ///   count up sequentially from the last value, similar to enum discriminants. No two
    ///   archetypes may have the same archetype ID (this is compiler-enforced).

    /// The `ecs_iter!` macro iterates over all entities matching the conditions of its closure
    /// and executes that closure on those entities' data. It takes the following arguments:
    ///
    /// - `world`: The world (as an expression) that you want to query.
    /// - `|comp_a: &CompA, comp_b: &mut CompB, ...| { ... }`: A closure containing the operation
    ///   to perform on the current entity's data. The parameters of the closure determine what
    ///   components for the entity that this query will access and how. Any component can be
    ///   accessed as `&Component` or `&mut Component`. The query will only check archetypes
    ///   that are known at compile-time to have all components requested in the query closure.
    ///     - Note that this closure is always treated as a `&mut FnMut`.
    ///
    /// # Special Arguments
    ///
    /// Query closure arguments can have the following special types:
    ///
    /// - `&Entity<A>`/`&EntityAny`: Returns the current entity being accessed by the closure.
    ///   This is somewhat redundant for `ecs_find!` queries, but useful for `ecs_iter!` loops.
    ///   Note that this is always read-only -- the entity can never be accessed mutably.
    /// - `&EntityRaw<A>`/`EntityRawAny`: As above, but using raw handles to the direct position
    ///   of the entity in its archetype. This can accelerate lookup, but may be invalidated
    ///   if the archetype changes. See [`EntityRawAny`] for more information.
    /// - `&Entity<_>`/`&EntityRaw<_>`: When used with the special `_` wildcard, each execution
    ///   of this query will return a typed (raw) entity handle for the exact archetype matched
    ///   for this specific execution. This can be used to optimize switched behavior by type.
    /// - `&OneOf<A, B, ...>` or `&mut OneOf<A, B, ...>`: See [`OneOf`](crate::OneOf).
    ///
    /// In query closures, a special `MatchedArchetype` type alias is set to the currently

/// A special parameter type for ECS query closures to match one of multiple components.
///
/// The `OneOf<A, B, C, ...>` pseudo-type argument to an ECS closure allows a query to match
/// exactly one of the given component types. The component can be accessed as a `&T` (or
/// `&mut T` for a `&mut OneOf<...>`), and is effectively duck-typed within the body of the
/// closure -- no traits or `where` clauses are needed to access elements of the component,
/// so long as the same element or method is available on all potential results of the `OneOf`
/// binding. If an archetype has more than one of the requested components in a `OneOf`, this
/// will result in a compilation error. This query will only match archetypes that have one of
/// the requested components.
///
/// ---
///
/// This is not a real struct and does not exist in any live code, it is a pseudo-type that
/// only has meaning within an ECS query closure when parsed by the operation macro. It is
/// presented here as a standalone struct for documentation purposes only.

///

/// use gecs::prelude::*;
///
/// pub struct CompA(pub u32);
/// pub struct CompB(pub u32);
/// pub struct CompC(pub u32);
///
/// ecs_world! {

///     ecs_archetype!(ArchBar, 5, CompA, CompC);
/// }
///

///     let entity_a = world.archetype_mut::<ArchFoo>().create((CompA(1), CompB(10)));
///     let entity_b = world.archetype_mut::<ArchBar>().create((CompA(1), CompC(10)));
///
///     let mut sum_a = 0;
///     let mut sum_b = 0;
///
///     // All three of these queries match both ArchFoo and ArchBar:
///     ecs_find!(world, entity_a, |v: &mut OneOf<CompB, CompC>| {
