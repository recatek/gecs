## [Unreleased]
- Split `View` into `View` and `ViewMut`. Note that creating a `View` still requires mutable access to the
  archetype/world, but can be useful for passing around read-only access to a given entity.
- The `iter`/`iter_mut` functions on archetypes now return a `View`/`ViewMut` with named component fields rather than
  anonymous tuples, making element access less sensitive to component order changes. This also makes iteration more
  compatible with the `ArchetypeHas` trait, as that can be used to generically access components from views.
